# What is this?

Me trying to learn Rust by implementing basic algorithms and data structures in it.

## How do I run?

Just use `rustc <name of file>` to create an executable file.

### Algorithms/Data Structures Implemented:

#### Basic Sorting:

- [x] Bubble Sort
- [x] Insertion Sort

#### Linear and Binary Search:

- [x] Linear Search
- [x] Binary Search

#### Data Structures:

- [x] Linked Lists
- [x] Stacks and Queues

#### Complex Sorting Algorithms:

- [x] Merge Sort
- [x] Quick Sort

#### Trees:

- [ ] Binary Search Trees
- [ ] AVL Trees/Red-Black Trees

#### Graph Algorithms:

- [ ] Depth First Search (DFS)
- [ ] Breadth First Search (BFS)
- [ ] A\* Search
- [ ] Iterative-Deepening Depth First Search (IDDFS)
- [ ] Djikstra's Algorithm
